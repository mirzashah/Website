    <h1 class="portfolio">Disc Jockey (DJ)</h1>
    <p class="portfolio">In my spare time, I am an electronic dance music (EDM) DJ known as DJ MaS. I am available for hire on-demand or as a resident DJ at your venue whether it's a club, lounge, bar, warehouse, restaurant or private residence. Check out my <a href="contact.htm">Contact Page</a> if you are interested in my services.</p>

    <h2 class="portfolio">What Does a DJ Do?</h2> 
    <p class="portfolio">People often do not realize what the job of a DJ is and what they are doing behind the scenes. A DJ is that person at the party (whether at the club, a wedding, or wherever) usually wearing big headphones and doing magic handwaving behind a booth (known as "spinning records" in DJ speak). Most DJs do not compose or generate the music on-the-fly (like a live band), but rather their goal is to spin the "right" prerecorded tracks to create a very specific aura and mood. A good DJ, in contrast to a bad one, can be all the difference in making a party fun and crazy rather than boring and dull. DJs do not just randomly select songs and play them, rather they carefully choose what they play to create the right vibe by reading people and making sure people are having a good time. The majority of a DJ's time is not spent playing events, but rather searching for, listening to, and learning about music. DJs spend countless hours hunting down tracks at record stores, on the Internet, radio, by word of mouth, or any other means necessary to find the perfect musical gems to make their audiences go wild!<br><br>

However, DJing is not only about choosing the right tracks -- it is also about the art of <i>mixing</i>. A DJ's equipment allows them to <i>mix</i> tracks together. On a dance floor, if the music stops for even a moment, or there is clashing between songs, it creates awkwardness and ruins the flow of the night. A good DJ will create smooth transitions between tracks using techniques such as beatmatching, phrasing, and harmonic mixing, never create an unintentional pause, use loops, samples, effects, and scratching to spice up tracks, mashup songs to create new ones, change style and tempo on-the-fly to create the perfect atmosphere, and be in complete control of people's bodies and emotions without them even realizing it! This is why DJs cannot and have not been replaced by jukeboxes, CD players, or the playlist you made with iTunes!</p></div>

    <h2 class="portfolio">Style and Format</h2> 
    <p class="portfolio">
My goal as a DJ is to give my clients and their patrons a night they will never forget. The types of dance music I primarily play are trance, house, and progressive with a BPM (beats-per-minute) range between 120-150 BPM and a 4/4 time signature. I typically play long solo sets that usually last from 3-7 hours. Like most EDM DJs, I attempt to create an exciting and magical musical journey that cycles between the tranquil, to the hypnotic, to the romantic, to all out dance floor rage! I also have a variety of lasers, lights, fog machines, and other equipment that are available on request. If your venue does not provide a sound system, I can provide a PA system for modest sized rooms. Larger rooms will require additional third-party equipment rental that I can arrange.</p>

    <div id="about_page">
    <h2 class="portfolio">Disclaimer</h2> 
    <p class="portfolio">Though I take requests, I do not play and refuse to play Top 40, pop, hip-hop or any non-EDM music (with the exception of remixes and mashups). As a DJ, it is my job to make sure people are having fun, enjoying themselves, and dancing. I can only do that if I have full control. We DJs often quip that we are not jukeboxes. A good DJ can read a crowd and can rock out a place even if folks there are not into their particular musical genre -- it&#39;s about figuring out what makes that particular crowd resonate. If people are not having fun, I have failed as a DJ. In that case I am happy to put on a CD and leave without pay. However, my experience has shown me that folks are usually not disappointed (especially those that are not familiar with EDM) and request my services again in the future.</p>

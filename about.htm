    <h1 class="portfolio">About Me</h1>
    <p class="portfolio">In a nutshell, I am a computer geek. Since I was a child, I have been tinkering with electronics and computers. I have been programming since I was 9, like many starting with the BASIC programming language. I have been a professional software developer since 2004 with the emphasis of my work in the area of autonomous robotics (i.e. robots that can operate on their own) and programming language implementation. When I'm not geeking out, I enjoy playing tennis, working out, <a href="dj.htm">DJing</a>, and reading/learning about everything and anything!</p>

    <h2 class="portfolio">Computer Scientist</h2> 
<p class="portfolio">I really really love computer science and hold both a BS in Computer Science and MS in Computer Science & Engineering from <a href="http://www.psu.edu">Penn State University</a>. There is nothing more profound and mind-blowing to me than the concept of computation and all the power it holds. My particular research interests and specialities are in autonomous robotics, artificial intelligence, and programming languages. What makes me strong as a software developer is my emphasis on computer science fundamentals and applying theory to real-life problems. In other words, I try to attempt to merge academia with application. My strong computer science foundation allows me to be a &quot;jack of all trades&quot; as a software developer -- robotics, 3D graphics, programming language/compiler implementation, scientific computing, distributed computing, games, mobile apps, databases...anything you want I can make it happen. What I think is most important is that even being out of school, I maintain the &quot;academic spirit&quot; and am always trying to learn more about my field simply because I love it. I hope one day to return to school to complete a doctorate in computer science.</p></div>

    <h2 class="portfolio">Software Developer, Roboticist, and Entrepreneur</h2> 
   <p class="portfolio">From 2004 until December 2011 I worked as a software engineer at <a href="http://www.arl.psu.edu">Penn State&apos;s Applied Research Laboratory (ARL)</a> - a defense research institution. The majority of my tenure there involved working on autonomous robots used primarily in military applications. Most of the robots I worked on were autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) though I have worked on ground and aerial vehicles as well. My primary emphasis was on writing the software that powers the autonomy of those vehicles (i.e. I created the brains of the robots). I also had to write the drivers for the various sensors, support tools like visual displays, simulators, and anything else we needed. I was often the lead software developer for our projects and participated in many field tests. My last 2 years at ARL were focused less on robotics and more on operations research - a field of study focused on solving difficult decision-making problems which were usually computationally-intensive and required a good understanding of computation theory, data structures, and algorithms. Working in operations research, we would solve difficult logistics and tactical strategy problems for military warfare applications (e.g. what are the most optimal ways [mathematically] for a submarine to engage a potential threat?)</p>

   <p class="portfolio">After leaving my position at Penn State, I moved out to the Bay Area in an attempt to create a consumer robotics venture called Emoto Robotics. At Emoto, I am trying to create robots that have personality, human-awareness, intelligence, and are seemingly-sentient. My belief is that the reason consumer robots have not gone beyond the Roomba is that robots are still not relatable -- they seem like machines rather than living beings. The main product I have created is a software stack that gives robots these characteristics along with a prototype that runs said software. Robots that run the Emoto software stack become autonomous beings with state-of-the-art facial tracking (i.e. they know who you are and can follow you), speech recognition, a sophisticated emotions and relationship model, and other anthropomorphically desired behaviors.</p>

    <h2 class="portfolio">Teaching</h2> 
   <p class="portfolio">During my last semester at Penn State, I taught introductory programming to absolute novice, non-technical undergraduate majors. I was the sole teacher for a class of 156 students while also performing my duties at ARL. As a student myself at one point, I was disappointed with the state of computer science education in the U.S. and the way programming and computer science were taught at major universities and wanted to try to make a difference. I designed <a href="http://www.theshahrevolution.com/CMPSC101">my own course</a> with all materials focused around making computation fun, interesting, and accessible. I started by writing the textbook for the class in the form of a wiki which was and still is freely available to all my students and anybody who wants it in the world. I believe education should be as low-cost as possible, open source, and accessible to anybody who wants to put in the effort. I built the course around the idea of practicality, doing things like making games and controlling robots. I spent a lot of time writing software libraries for my students so that they could do fun and interesting things. I basically did not sleep for five months, but the students enjoyed it so much and the majority were so grateful that it was all worth it -- I even ended up with a few students switching their majors to computer science!</p>

    <div id="about_page">
    <h2 class="portfolio">Present Day</h2> 
   <p class="portfolio">Currently I am still working on the Emoto Robotics venture. Though I have come a long way with the initial Emoto prototype, I have had difficulty raising capital (getting VCs to believe in hardware is hard!) and have turned it back into a sideproject. Therefore, I am currently on the job market looking for both full-time positions and/or consulting positions as a software engineer or project manager, preferably in the area of robotics. However, I am open to any software development positions as long as the problems are challenging, interesting, and require computer science. If you think I maybe a good fit for your organization, please check out my <a href="resume.htm">resume</a> and <a href="contact.htm">contact</a> me if you would like to talk!</p>
